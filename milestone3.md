### UI comparing to previous milestone:
  Previously in m2, lots of our pages were only on a skeleton level, with only text and button to show functionalities. Till today, we have made the aesthetic clearer and nicer by adding css to div containers, bodies, and etc. In addition, we also added color and changed the size of many buttons in our app. Alignments and padding issues were also fixed in most pages.
