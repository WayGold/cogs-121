## Project Proposal:
  Hi, we are team "ZZZZ". This quarter, we are designing for the people with
  disabilities.
  Introducing our web-app "#TBD#", a platform for people with disabilities to seek help with daily matters.  
  How does "#TBD#" works? #TBD# is not only a platform to seek help, we are making it a platform to provide help as well. People with disabilities could submit a request to our platform while the volunteers could accept the tickets.

## Why #TBD# fits the project theme?
  We believe that this is a meaningful and helpful platform that our target population **NEEDS**. From our friends experiences, there's always some moments that they need helps from others. However, it isn't always easy to ask for help. "TBD" provides a fast, safe and convenient platform for people with disabilities to solve there needs.
