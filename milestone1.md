## Project Proposal:
  Hi, we are team "ZZZZ". This quarter, we are designing for the people with
  disabilities.
  Introducing our web-app "#TBD#", a platform for people with disabilities to seek help with daily matters.  
  How does "#TBD#" works? #TBD# is not only a platform to seek help, we are making it a platform to provide help as well. People with disabilities could submit a request to our platform while the volunteers could accept the tickets.

## Why #TBD# fits the project theme?
  The theme of the project is to design for people who are very different from ourselves. All of our team members are physically and mentally healthy. We believe that this is a meaningful and helpful platform that our target population **NEEDS**. Our app connects volunteers with people with disabilities who needs assistance via quick matching system based on our unique algorithm. From our friends experiences, there's always some moments that people with disabilities need helps from others. However, it isn't always easy to ask for help. "TBD" provides a fast, safe and convenient platform for people with disabilities to solve their needs.

## Possible API that we could use:
  We plan to use the Google Map API so that we can access the location info and use the distance matrix API to calculate the distance between the requester and volunteers so that we can sort the tickets. Also we can mark the destination for the volunteers etc.
