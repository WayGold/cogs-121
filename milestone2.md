## Idea Follow-Up & Restatement  
Nothing changed. We will continue designing for the people with disabilities.
"Ezhelp" will be a platform where people in need could seek helps, and people
with passion and love could provide any kinds of help that people need.

## Early Development: UI Skeletons (April.27th ~ 30th)  

### Back-end:
  Server implemented with Express & Node.js. At this stage, the server loads htmls
from the static files directory with functionalities (1.) to get all users from
 the user table in our SQLite3 database, (2.) post funciton to write request
 information into the request_info table in the database and (3.) to get all
 request info from the database.

### Front-end:
  The front-end access the data from back-end via ajax calls and feed the infos
  back to the htmls.
